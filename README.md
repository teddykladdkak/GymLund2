# GymLund.tk
## What is this?
This project is based on [GymLund](https://github.com/teddykladdkak/GymLund). The code is now not dependent on server logic and local updates, but everything is now rendered by the user and data is loaded from [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BWtH6cBOzcdUlIywS7DqZcROSsQoC5F9p2NMYUhgFys/edit?usp=sharing).

It all started when I wanted to visit all the Pokémon Go gyms in my city. For this I made a list that could be checked. During this period, Gym Badges were also implemented in Pokémon Go, so add them to the page. In various forums I participated in, there were constant users asking where the gym was. I solved the problem by making some adjustments and then GymLund became what it is today!

## Where does the information come from?
All photos from Gym Badges are from my personal account. If a gym badge is displayed with a question mark, it means that I have heard that there should be a gym but have not yet visited it.

I find the gym's location partly through Facebook groups but also through the following pages:
* [PokemonGoMap](https://www.pokemongomap.info/)
* [Ingress - Intel](https://www.ingress.com/intel)

**OBS! Risk finns att gym saknas, då denna sida inte drivs av bottar utan spelares observationer**
